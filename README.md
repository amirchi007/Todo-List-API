# Todo-List-API
A simple RESTful API for managing tasks with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It supports HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and stores data in a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB). The project uses Docker for containerization and follows the MVC architecture for maintainability.
